I'm not in my best shape right now, but I'll be back at my peak soon.
I had some ideas that I thought might work better, but I stuck to the instructions.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Project Setup

```sh



npm  install



```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh



npm  run  dev



```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh



npm  run  build



```
